-- i want to practise some commands like some select commands i want to practise 
use AdventureWorks2017
--This is the command to accept all values from a table.
select * from HumanResources.Employee
--when u want to accept particular columns just list out...like this.
select JobTitle ,Gender,LoginID from HumanResources.Employee
--using the Department table...

select * from HumanResources.Department

--These are the 3 ways to change the column names....

select 'Department Number'=DepartmentID,'DepartmentName'=Name from HumanResources.Department

select DepartmentID as 'Department Number',Name as 'Department Name' from HumanResources.Department



--suppose we want to make results more explanatory...in such a case u can add more text to the value..
--displayed by columns using literals...

select BusinessEntityID ,'Desgination: ',JobTitle from HumanResources.Employee

--suppose u want to view results in different manner...u may want to display the 
--values of multiple columns in a single column
--also to improve readability...u use concatenation operator...
--second thing is they are used only for strings...not for numbers


select Name + '   department comes under  '+ GroupName +'  group   ' as Department from HumanResources.Department
--sometimes u need to find out the columns operation also...

select * from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory

select BusinessEntityID,Rate,per_day_rate=8*Rate from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory

--there may be situation where u want to retrive the selected rows...

select * from HumanResources.Department where groupname='research and development'

--inside where clause u can use comaprison operators to specify condtions...

--again let us see table do some operation...

select * from HumanResources.Employee
--here relational operators are used...to check condition
select BusinessEntityID ,NationalIDNumber,JobTitle,VacationHours from 
HumanResources.Employee where VacationHours >
20
--to use logiccal operators...

--because to check for more conditions...

select * from humanresources.Department where Groupname='Manufacturing' or Groupname='Inventory management'

select * from Humanresources.Employee where JobTitle='production Technician - wc60' and Gender='M'

select * from HumanResources.Department where Groupname='Manufacturing' or NOT GroupName='quality Assurance'

--just now we have seen logial operators....
--now between and not between oprator is used for the range purpose...

select BusinessEntityID,VacationHours  from Humanresources.Employee
where vacationhours between 20 and 50

select BusinessEntityID,VacationHours from Humanresources.Employee where
vacationhours not between 20 and 80
--when we want to find the value in the given set of values...

1)count:it will give u no of rows in a table 

select * from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory

select count(rate) as 'noofrows',count(*) from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory

eg: select count(*) from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory
2)sum:it give u sum of all the values in 
column having numeric values
eg:select sum(Rate) from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory
3)max: it will give me highest value in column
eg: select max(Rate) from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory
4)min;it will give me the lowest value in column
eg: select min(Rate) from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory
5)avg: it will give the average of column
 means sum_of_ numbers /total_no_of_values present in a column
eg: select avg(Rate) from HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory

--Group By 
------------
-- whatever columns are there in select clause that should be there in 
---group by clause also if not there then apply aggregate functions to the column of select clause 
 -- but when u dont hav much columns like single column only then u can use aggregate function as per the need of the qeustion 
-- when ever they are asking for each ,for every apply group by to column with repeated values

some assingment 
-----------------
First create three tables like this one is students and another is classes and another is studentclass 
so there is many to many  relation ship between two tables so i have here one junction table okay so 
now to answer the question never join student with classes table okay see in the answer i had joined the tables using juntion table which is studentclass 


--assingment 
drop table students
  create table students(studentid int ,studentname varchar(30));
insert into students values(1,'john'),(2,'Matt'),(3,'James');
create table classes(classid int ,classname varchar(30));
insert into classes values(1,'art'),(2,'history'),(3,'Maths');
create table studentclass(studentid int,classid int );
insert into studentclass values(1,1),(1,2),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3);

select * from students;
select * from classes;
select * from studentclass;

Q)what will be best possible join if i want to know all 
the students u have taken classes ?

select distinct s1.studentname  from Students s1 join StudentClass sc on sc.studentid=s1.studentid

Q) what will be the best possible join if we want to retrive 
all the students who have 
not signed for any batches ?

select distinct students.studentname  from 
students left join studentclass on students.studentid=
studentclass.studentid left  join classes on classes.classid 
=studentclass.classid where classes.classid is null; 

or 

SELECT  s.studentname FROM students s LEFT JOIN studentclass sc ON s.studentid = sc.studentidWHERE sc.studentid IS NULL;self join 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
self join means joining the table with itself now here only one table is there okay 
and in this table only some body is manaager for some body so as per question i had done self join 
for the same table two objects i created .


create table Employee(id int primary key ,
name varchar(50) not null,
managerid int );


insert into employee values(1,'mike',3),(2,'David',3),(3,'Roger',null),(4,'Marry',2),(5,'Joseph',2),
(7,'Ben',2);

select * from employee;


Q1) give me all the employees with names and their coresspnding manager means display 
-- employee name and manager name as well 

select e1.name as employeename  ,e2.name as manager from  Employee e1 join Employee e2 on e1.managerid=e2.id;

Q2)-- give me the name of the employee also in the list who is not having manager 
-- and if he is top manager of the company tell it as top manager like that okay 
-- hint copy the same above code and for null specify left and use ifnull function over here 
-- like this u can do it for any column by joining any no of tables eventhough u dont 
-- have to perfom self join and instead null display temperorlay some value means use ifnull okay 

 select e1.name as employeename ,isnull(e2.name,'CEO') as manager from  Employee e1 left join Employee e2 on e1.managerid=e2.id;


  select * from dept3 
select * from emp3;

select * from dept3 cross join emp3 ;--something matix multiplication 


Subqueries :
------------
Query inside another query we call it as subquery 
here parent query where clause value should match with child query select clause value while
 defining subqueries .
here i am talking about a select command inside an another select comand okay so here 
here in subquery the child select  clause is independent of parent clause means individually it can give me output 
it is not depending on parent query 

use HCL;
